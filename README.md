# Rubiks Cube solver project

My first bigger project, a `C++` program solving Rubik's cube.

## Overview

Goal of the project is to make working solver, using Fibonacci queue structure, and A*/IDA* algorithm.

## Modules

- `Fibonacci_queue` - implements priority queue written using generics, using Fibonaci queue structure.
- `CubeState_t` - implements class for storing Rubik's cube state.
- `Cube_t` - implements class for solving the cube.

## Progress
